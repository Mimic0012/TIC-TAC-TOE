Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! ðŸŽ®

This is a simple yet addictive game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
Features:

Single-Player Mode: Play against a basic AI opponent.

Two-Player Mode: Enjoy a classic face-off against a friend.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for seamless gameplay.

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
