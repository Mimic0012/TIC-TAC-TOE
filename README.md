# TIC-TAC-TOE
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! ðŸŽ®

This is a simple yet addictive game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
